[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/DrStephPowers/business-degree/master)

Lesson 1: Learning Python Script through Games - Turtles.ipynb

Class activity from Callysto (https://callysto.ca/), an educational resource for grades 5 to 12 that uses Python to teach traditional curriculum.

Lesson 2: Analyzing Survey Data - Analyze Survey.ipynb

Create graphs and descriptive statistics. Perform hypothesis tests. Analyze qualitative and quantative data.Example code from DrStephPowers shows feedback from students on gamifying a first year class of 80 students.

Lesson 3: Web Scraping and GIS

Scrape data from websites and create choropleth (heat) maps. Example code from RitVikMath (https://github.com/ritvikmath/StarbucksStoreScraping) scrapes information about Starbucks locations in Las Angeles.

Lesson 4: Voronoi Polygons.ipynb

Create Voronoi Polygons overlayed on a map to partition the customer base and determine the catchment area for each organization.
Example code from JeffMyLife (https://github.com/jeffmylife/casual/blob/master/Voromap.ipynb) to show hospitals in the US with heliports and the geographic areas they service.

Lesson 5: Natural Language Processing and Sentiment Analysis

Analyze Twitter posts to determine if opinions are positive or negative. Example code from prateekjoshi565 (https://github.com/prateekjoshi565/twitter_sentiment_analysis/blob/master/code_sentiment_analysis.ipynb) to show how sentiment analysis is used to flag hate speech. The same process can be used to determine what type of comments are being made about a candidate or a company.
