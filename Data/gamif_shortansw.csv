5,Not really,"Good, I like how we have in-class activities",Don't really like the challenges,Less assignments to better help control,No,
6,,It was properly done,,An overall better system than regular grading. Providing competition and learning as a singular opportunity made the XP worth while,,
7,,,,,,
8,,,,,,
9,,,,,,
10,,,,,,
11,,,,,,
12,Amazing,,,Funa dn its nice to be engaged in the class,It is different and positive experience,
13,Love it,,Love how there are mini tests and not exams,,Wish more courses were like this,
14,,,,,,
15,,,,I am flighthing to get one,,
16,,,,,,
17,,,,,,
18,,,Great for individuals who don't test well,,,
19,,,,,,
20,,,,,,
21,,,,,,
22,It helped me understand more,,,It's a good way to track my score in comparison to others,It was fun,
23,"I didn't mind the gamification, however I do prefer a traditional style class",It was good,,I just like to know my grades,,
24,,Sometimes lectures were too hard to follow and couldn't gather all the information needed for curates and assignments,Quizzes seemed to be nothing similar to what we learned in the course. I didn't do great on any of the quizzes,,,
25,,,,,,
26,The narrative if not the issue I was harsh on it originally which is why I changed it to a 4,Everything feels too rushed I do not retain enough info,"I don't have correct notes to do them, I need to take my own notes not curate fill in the blanks",I didn't care for the rewards. I heard no tests and went into auto pilot not realizing all these little assignments everywhere would be a nuissance,Do multiple levels at a time then tie them together to minimize amount of assignments I time ,
27,,,,,The fact that you have the class recorded on Youtube ready to watch it at anytime is Amazing,
28,Can it be something less fringe and more realistic?,Some games were distracting and confusing,Too many small assignments spread out in various levels it was hard to track. I always felt behind,Didn't like coins. XP is ok but grages posted like other classes are better,Lectures were great. Well planned and executed. Notes were overwhelming. I have my own style. I don't like loose leaf papers,
29,,,,,,
30,,,,,,
31,,,,,,
32,,,"I didn't entirely like the no exams, I use them to benchmark my progress.",,,
33,,,,,,
34,,,,,,
35,,,,,,
36,,,,,,
37,It si very useful to me when we have games in classroom to play. I understand better,,,,I think this course helped me a lot because I have lots of challenges to do and the challenges were all related to real world,
38,,,,,,
39,Would be more likely to be successful if done in conjunction with the rest of western Canada,,,,,
40,,,,,,
41,,,,,,
42,,,,,,
43,,,,,Games often took too long to set up and needed lots of explanation. They were hard to understand what was going on as it was very chaotic,
44,,,,,,
45,,Curate sheets help keep the focus on the information,Like the variety of the challenges enjoy that they all aren't essays. Enjoy the open book quizzes. The mix of optional group work and individual assignments,Should be able to collect coins and use all at once or should be able to use coins to transfer to XP. Every 3 coins equals 1 XP (like seven wonders),My favourite course this summer,
46,,,,Too many points have been left until the end of the class schedule. It was stressful wondering how to pass the course when so few points were available early on,Having assignments marked faster would make earning XP points more enjoyable and push the gamified structure be more fun to follow,
47,,,,,To much XP due at the end of the course. Would have been more enjoyable if it was more spread out,
48,,,,,,
49,,Too much work towards the end,I like the assignment style,,I feel like my work has been stolen a few times if not more,
50,,,,,"It's an Ok idea, but I felt it wasn't delivered properly. I never knew what I needed to improve on with my assignments to get a better work. I rarely paid attention in class because I didn't have to work the curates. Also, I Felt we should have done more in class problems individually so we could actually practice/ learn how to do the problems","I felt I never learned anything because we never reviewwed quizzez or assignments, never really had to chance to voice questions about the quizzes and assignments and therefore never increased our understnading."
51,"We didn't touch on this much, or as much as we could have",The monopoly game and shopping games were a complete waste of time. The class size is too big for activities like these to take placce,Too much inconsitency in marking and it took too long to get our grades back,All that the competitive nature did was make people chest. There was no benefit to me as a student trying to compete with my fellow students for events,This delivery was a complete joke. I did not learn as much about macro as I would have liked to . I attended every class and completed every assignment but my grade is not reflecting this.,
52,,,,,,
53,No comments,More time working on assignments,No comments,Hard to track,Hard to know where you sit,
54,Interesting coarse,Less pressure than other methods of delivery and testing,Easier means of assessment,Make prices for coins more valuable,,
55,,I think it was a bit unorganized and the end was very rushed,,,"It would be better if it were mor eorganized (handouts, schedule at end of semester)",
56,,,,,,
57,Its okay,good  ,Too many  ,I don’t really care about coins,"Too many projects at the end, have them spread out",
58,,,,,,
59,,,,The XP Is only renaming  %,I like the assignment heavy no exam style,
60,,,,I love this style because you do what you can,,
61,,"Having class activities makes it a little easier to apply the learning to ""real life"" scenarios",I like the in class quizzes and being able to use curate sheets,I like that it is optional,I enjoyed this way of learning,
62,,,,,,
63,,,,It is a good idea,I enjoyed it,
64,,,,,,
65,,,,,,
66,,No,No,no  ,Not really,I identify as a helicopter (in gender question)
67,,,,,I enjoyed it because it was way less stressful especially at the end of the semester when all my other work was piling up. It helped to know I had already passed a course.,
68,,,,,,
69,I live that the course is gamified but I don't proper focussing on a single topic. The class was still made enjoyable and very well taught,,,,,
70,,I like the lectures,Like em,I like that I can compare my grade to the whole class,,
71,,Enjoy the style of course but the end seems rushed to gain XP,,Didn't get one  so I don’t know,"Don't like how people can go through my submissions (paper copy), would prefer electronic submissions",
72,,,,,,
73,,,,,,
74,,I really dislike all the demonstrations. I find they are a waste of time and I don't learn very much. The concepts are simple and don't reflect the difficulty within the assignments and challenges. I don't feel demonstrations help me learn at all.,,,,I really enjoyed Youtube videos
75,Pick something actually happening that we can follow and observe,"I feel there should have been more time for questions/ on topic conversations less time an games (didn't help me learn, was fun, but no academic benefit)",See mare Jerry copy his outline,don't insentivise,Stephanie is great but the course structure was over ambicious and missed the mark,"2 mid terms, 1 final and 3 major assignments that mimik exams that can be completed in groups of 1-2 people. Its 2019, this does not impact my opinion being a female or my age is not going to be a deciding factor in how I experience this course. I dislike being asked this."
76,"Making ECON 101 gamified with the overarching narrative of Alberta's independancce brought me to understand how economics worked and gave me insight on who to vote for , for the next provincial election in Alberta",,,,,
77,,Really good concept enjoyed more that I thought . Good time management,,Not doing for rewards bu for the marks,"Like the idea of do the work, and you should pass",
78,,,,,,
79,,,,,,
80,,,Liked that there was no final but wish there were more smaller quizzez through out the chapters,Didn't really care about the rewards just wanted to do very best,,
81,,,,,,
82,,,,,,
83,,,,,,
84,,,,,,
85,,"Because the class was so large, the in-class activities were sometimes hard to follow",There was an excess of assignments in this course,Didn't at time feel rewarded for y efforts appropriately which made my effort change,Was hard to know where it stood at times,There is a lot of info to get through. Maybe too much?
86,,,,,,
87,,,,,,
88,,,,,,
89,,,,,,
90,,Monopoly was fun,,,,
91,,,,,,
92,,,,,It might 've been an okay approach if we didn't fall behind and ended up having to complete 400 XP in the last month of class to get the grade we aimed for.,
93,,,,"Instead of coins hould have made something so coins count towards XP, more opportunitites to earn XP on different days of the week",I believe we should have been at atleast a 50 in the course by the middle of the semseter/ middle of levels. It makes these last few weeks very stressful,
94,,,,,,
95,"Not too bad, I like the structure with the curate sheets and assignments that follow",,,,Would rather have a normal course with exams,
96,,,,,"In the beginning she said you could pick your grade by putting in effort accordingly. That didn't work, I put tons of work in for an average mark.",
97,,,,,,
98,,,,"I didn't valve the rewards enough, I assume the same went for a lot of students",,
99,"I like the idea and I know Stehanie did her best to instruct but lectures felt rushed, there was too much content trying to follow this game which didn't allwo for enough absorbtion fo knowledge.",,,,,
